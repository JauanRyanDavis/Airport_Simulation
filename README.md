Airport_Simulation
==================

Airport Simulation is a program that demonstrates the functionality of the linked queue data structure applied to a real world situatiion. The objective was to transform the linked queue into a priority queue and rank its objects based on a comparable attribute, that being fuel for this application. The program acts as a airport making the decision about what plane to allow clearance to land giving the user the ability to elapse simulation time, add a new plane to the queue, show planes that are waiting, and end the program. The planes information and fuel amount are generated randomly when the user selects the option to add a new plane to the queue. Instructions stated that planes are allowed to land every 2 minutes and as the time elapses on the simulation, the fuel of the awaiting planes decrement.  Messages are displayed both when a plane lands saftly and when it crashes with the planes information. The trick is to see if you can empty the queue withput having any planes crashing.
